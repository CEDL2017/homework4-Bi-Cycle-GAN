# Homework4 report

### What scenario do I apply in?
you are encouraged to elaborate the motivation here

### What do I modify? 
you can show some snippet

### Qualitative results
put some interesting images generated from your Bi-CycleGANs

### My thoughts 
you can make some comments on the your own homework, e.g. what's the strength? what's the limitation?<br>
I think cycle GAN can process two object with similar geometric structure but only change the color , attribute , style.<br>
Cycle GAN did well on style transfer,but when we'd like to see some structure change, it didn't process that well.<br>
