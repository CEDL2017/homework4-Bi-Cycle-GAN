# Homework4 report

### What scenario do I apply in?
I use three different modalities in this work.
There are apples(A), oranges(B) and lemons(C) respectively.

The original publication of CycleGAN has acheived amazing result of apple2oranges, 
and what I want to do is further the modality in this scenario.

### What do I modify? 
Actually I hardly modify any code of the original PyTorch implementaion.

### Qualitative results

### My thoughts 
The biggest challenge of this work is to modify the original code to extract multiple and different modalities from the images.
