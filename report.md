# Homework4 report

### What scenario do I apply in?
I apply the bi-cycle GAN to the famous images, which transfer the image style among Ukiyoe, Monet, Vangogh and photos. The main motivation is to see what the famous paintings would look like if other artists paint the same scenery.

### What do I modify? 
For now, I only apply different datasets to the Cycle GAN and haven't modified the Bicycle GAN.

### Qualitative results
First I'll show the results for single cycle GAN. The first image is the original one, the second is transferred image and the last is the reconstructed image.

Following is the images from Vangogh, transferred to common domain, photo, and then transferred to Ukiyoe Style.

### My thoughts 

you can make some comments on the your own homework, e.g. what's the strength? what's the limitation?
